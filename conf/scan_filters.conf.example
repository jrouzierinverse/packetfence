# Scan filter configuration
# 
# you can trigger rule on specific scope (PortalScan, DHCPScan)
#
# Make a simple rule like this:
#
# [category]
# filter = node_info
# operator = is
# attribute = category
# value = default
#
# [1:category]
# scope = PortalScan
# role = nointernet
#
# It means that when PacketFence tries to get the normal VLAN for the node and if the category of the node is
# the default one, we return the role "nointernet" (which you will have configured in the switch configuration).
#
# Advanced rule:
#
# [2]
# filter = node_info
# attribute = category
# operator = match
# value = ^default$
#
# [3]
# filter = ssid
# operator = is
# value = OpenWrt-SECURE
#
# [4]
# filter = time
# operator = is
# value = wd {Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri} hr {11am-2pm}
#
# [2:2&3&4]
# scope = PortalScan
# role = nointernet
#
# [3:3]
# scope = NormalScan
# action = trigger_violation
# action_param = mac = $mac, tid = 1100010, type = INTERNAL
#
# It means that if the SSID is OpenWrt-SECURE then we send a API call to the function trigger_violation and
# trigger the violation 1100010
#
# action_param is computed by PacketFence so you can set static and dynamic values
#
# filter can be:
#
#     node_info.autoreg
#     node_info.status
#     node_info.device_class

#
# operator can be:

#    Ethernet-EAP
#    Ethernet-NoEAP
#    SNMP-Traps
#    Inline
#    WIRED_MAC_AUTH
#
# - for the radius_request
#    All the attributes you can have in the RADIUS request (run FreeRADIUS in debug mode to see these attributes)
#
# action can be:
#
#    deregister_node (require param => mac)
#    register_node (require param => mac pid)
#    modify_node (require param => mac)
#    trigger_violation (require param => mac tid type)
#
# action_param can be:
#    The require param and optional attributes like (for action = modify_node):
#    action_param = mac = $mac, notes = $radius_request->{'Called-Station-Id'}
#
#
# The value of a time is specific and follow this logic:
# http://search.cpan.org/~pryan/Period-1.20/Period.pm
# For example, if you want to allow access from Monday to Friday, 9am to 11am and from 2pm to 4pm:
# wd {Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri} hr {9am-11am}, wd {Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri} hr {2pm-4am}
